                    <p>I'm sorry to hear that your Instagram account has been leaked. Here are some steps you can take to try to regain control and secure your account:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Change Your Password Immediately: If you can still access your account, change your password right away. Make sure to choose a strong password that includes a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security to your account. Even if someone knows your password, they won't be able to log in without the second factor, usually a code sent to your phone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. Revoke Access to Suspicious Third-Party Apps: Go to your Instagram settings and review the third-party apps that have access to your account. Revoke access to any apps that you don't recognize or trust.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. Report the Issue to Instagram: If you can't access your account or if you suspect that it has been compromised, report the issue to Instagram immediately. They may be able to help you recover your account.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        5. Check for any Unauthorized Activity: Look through your account for any posts, messages, or changes that you didn't make. This can give you an idea of what the person who accessed your account did.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        6. Notify Your Followers: Once you've regained control of your account, consider posting a message to let your followers know that your account was compromised. This can help prevent them from falling victim to any scams or malicious activity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        7. Monitor Your Account: Keep an eye on your account for any further suspicious activity. If you notice anything unusual, take action immediately.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        8. Stay Vigilant: Going forward, be cautious about the information you share online and the links you click on. Regularly update your passwords and enable security features like 2FA whenever possible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you've done all of these steps and are still having trouble, you may need to reach out to Instagram's support team for further assistance.</p>
